Personal Work realized for Java SE module of my ENI cursus.

Comment: I renamed french variables to english, per my personal preference. 

### PW1
- Status: Done
- Comments: 
  - I implemented Jupiter (JUnit5) and refactored the given trace tests in order to implement some Unit Testing. 
  - Could be improved and atomicized. 

### PW2
- Status: Done
- Comments:
  - Unit testing of POJO instances declared in PW1.
  - I could refactor PW1 tests and create one file per POJO.
  - I could test hashstring instead of testing toString equality.

### PW3
- Status: Done
- Comments:
  - Renamed BO to Models, BLL to Services, DAL to DAO, for convenience 
  - Optional exercise: implement MockEmployeeDAO, EmployeeManager and test methods
  - Instead of doing the optional exercise, I implemented Unit Testing

### PW4
- Status: Done
- Comments:
  - Optional exercise : implement singleton and factory pattern for EmployeeDAO
  - I didn't do it because I found it to be redundant

### PW5
- Status: Ongoing
- Comments:
  - Currently considering deleting short PW such as poo drills and turtlerace
